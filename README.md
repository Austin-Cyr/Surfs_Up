## Overview of the statistical analysis:

W. Avy is considering whether to open a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii. Before doing so, he would like to understand the temperatures in the two most extreme temperature weather months to determine if the business is sustainable year-round. The purpose of this analysis is to gather data about the temperature in these two months and identify the key differences. 


## Results:

The results of the analysis are shown in the following summary statistics for each month.

These results show only slight differences in the temperature for these two opposite season months: 

1. The mean temperature difference between each month is just over 3.5 degrees Farenheight. This is not a signficant difference. 
2. The max temperatures difference between each month is also small at just 2 degrees Farenheight.
3. However, the min temperatures are much greater. The December minimum temperature is 56 degrees, while the June minimum temperature is at 64 degrees. 

One interesting item is that the data does have 170 more temperature measurements in the month of June than in December. While this is only 10%, of the number of days in May, it is possible that this data may skew the results.

## Summary:

The results show a neglible difference in temperature averages and ranges between these two months. This should imply that sales during each month should not be signficantly different if the temperature is a determinable input for the business's outlook. 

In order to test this theory, it would also be helpful to gather the averages and ranges of temperatures for all months to compare. The reason for this is that for some locations around the world, December may not be the least warm month and June may not be the warmest month. Thus, we may not have the greatest extreme temperature months. 

Also, since the temperature was measured from multiple stations, it may be worthwhile to investigate the temperature from only the station nearest the potential business location.
